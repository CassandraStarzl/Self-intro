        <p>My favorite culture that I'm not native to would have to be the Asian culture, a vibrant tapestry woven from ancient traditions, philosophies, and modern innovations that captivate the senses and inspire awe. The allure of Asian culture lies not just in its rich history, encapsulated in the majestic architecture of temples, the intricate artistry of calligraphy, and the harmonious melodies of traditional music, but also in its profound respect for family values and community bonds that resonate deeply with me. I am particularly drawn to the culinary diversity that spans the continent, from the spicy, flavorful dishes of Southeast Asia to the delicate, artfully presented meals of Japan, where each bite feels like a celebration of life itself.</p>
        <p>Two historical figures that I relate to are Queen Elizabeth I and Rosa Parks, each embodying qualities that resonate with my own values and aspirations in unique ways. Queen Elizabeth, known for her remarkable reign during a time marked by political turmoil and cultural transformation, symbolizes resilience and strategic leadership—a reflection of my passion for the arts and literature. On the other hand, Rosa Parks serves as a powerful emblem of courage and unwavering commitment to justice. Her brave decision to refuse to give up her seat on a segregated bus sparked a movement and ignited the fight for civil rights in the United States, demonstrating that one individual's bold stand can ignite a tidal wave of activism and social change. I deeply admire Parks’ ability to confront societal injustice head-on and the profound impact her actions had on the world around her. In my own life, I aspire to channel her spirit of determination and advocacy, whether through community engagement, social activism, or simply by standing up for what I believe is right, echoing her legacy of commitment to equality and change. Together, these two iconic women inspire me to balance my love for culture with active participation in social discourse, embodying the belief that both art and activism can coexist and enhance one another in the pursuit of a better world.</p>
        <p>A meal that represents me is pizza, a dish that beautifully encapsulates the complexity and diversity of my personality. Much like a pizza, I am a blend of various elements—each ingredient adding a unique flavor and texture to the overall experience.</p>
        <p>I feel most creative when im out in nature with my Ipad and procreate app.Surrounded by the vibrant hues of wildflowers swaying gently in the breeze, the rustling leaves overhead, or the distant sound of a babbling brook, I find my mind bursting with inspiration</p>
